## Project Description

QualLi is a web application built in React.js, which the user will be able to select a top city in the world from a dropdown, and the site will return Quality of Life score. This information will be feteched from the Teleport Public Api and will incorporate 25 components.

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matix.  

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality is divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  The Minimimum Viable Product (MVP) will be the items that are incorporated into the application, and the Post-MVP items will be added if there is enough time.

#### MVP 

- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page 
- Minimum 3 components
- Conditional Rendering
- CRA Built
- Deployed via GitHub

#### PostMVP 

- D3
- CSS Animations
- Routing
- Local Storage
- Comparsions

## React Architectural Design

The main component will be the APP which will contain the "Header", "Menu", and "Categories." The Header will contain the Nav. The Menu will contain the Hero Image. The Categories will hold the following components: 
 -Housing
 -Cost of Living
 -Startups
 -Venture Capital
 -Travel Community
 -Commute
 -Business Freedom
 -Safety
 -Healthcare
 -Education
 -Enivorment 
 -Economy
 -Taxation
 -Internet Access
 -Leisure
 -Outdoors
 -Tolerance

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Header | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Footer | This will render the header include the nav | 


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Menu| H | 1hrs| hrs | hrs |
| Fetch API| H | 1hrs| 1hrs | 1hrs |
| Creating Components| H | 3hrs| hrs | hrs |
| Working with API | H | 4hrs| hrs | hrs |
| Conditional Rendering| L | 2hrs| hrs | hrs |
| HTML and CSS| L | 3hrs| hrs | hrs |
| CRA Built| H | .10hrs| .10hrs | .10hrs |
| Deployed via GitHub| H | .05hrs| .05hrs | .05hrs |
| D3| L | 3hrs| hrs | hrs |
| CSS Animations| L | 3hrs| hrs | hrs |
| Routing| L | 3hrs| hrs | hrs |
| Location Storage| L | 2hrs| hrs | hrs |
| Comparisons| L | 5hrs| hrs | hrs |
| Total | H | 36.15hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |

## Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

| Function | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Capitalize | This will capitalize the first letter in a string of text | 

## Additional Libraries
D3: D3.js is a JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers. It makes use of the widely implemented SVG, HTML5, and CSS standards. This will be used to better visualize the data of the quality of life scores. 

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description  

```
function reverse(string) {
  // here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```
